# Ground-Swath Project
➢ Developed a python API to determine the spatial coverage for orbiting Earth-facing satellites acquiring data simultaneously for region-of-interests
➢ The API leveraged a global database of footprints and performed relevant queries to determine the coverage based on platform and flight direction (ASCENDIING/DESCENDING)
➢ Leveraged the JPL Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project to enable users to quantify the temporal resolution of OPERA products generated from multiple satellites (e.g. Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B)
